    "\n",
    "Following are the steps I undertake while solving any ML problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the data** - After you download the data, start exploring features. Look at data types. Check variable classes. Create some univariate - bivariate plots to understand the nature of variables.\n",
    "2. **Understand the metric to optimise** - Every problem comes with a unique evaluation metric. It's imperative for you to understand it, specially how does it change with target variable.\n",
    "3. **Decide cross validation strategy** - To avoid overfitting, make sure you've set up a cross validation strategy in early stages. A nice CV strategy will help you get reliable score on leaderboard.\n",
    "4. **Start hyper parameter tuning** - Once CV is at place, try improving model's accuracy using hyper parameter tuning. It further includes the following steps:\n",
    "  * **Data transformations:** It involve steps like scaling, removing outliers, treating null values, transform categorical variables, do feature selections, create interactions etc.\n",
    "  * **Choosing algorithms and tuning their hyper parameters:** Try multiple algorithms to understand how model performance changes.\n",
    "  * **Saving results:** From all the models trained above, make sure you save their predictions. They will be useful for ensembling.\n",
    "  * **Combining models:** At last, ensemble the models, possibly on multiple levels. Make sure the models are correlated for best results."

    "3. **Sound Classification:** Common neural networks.\n",
    "4. **High cardinality categorical (like text data):** I use linear models, FTRL, Vowpal wabbit, LibFFM, libFM, SVD etc.\n",
    "5. For everything else, I use Gradient boosting machines (like XGBoost and LightGBM) and deep learning (like keras, Lasagne, caffe, Cxxnet). I decide what model to keep/drop in Meta modelling with feature selection techniques. Some of the feature selection techniques I use includes:\n",
    "  * Forward (cv or not) - Start from null model. Add one feature at a time and check CV accuracy. If it improves keep the variable, else discard.\n",
    "  * Backward (cv or not) - Start from full model and remove variables one by one. It CV accuracy improves by removing any variable, discard it.\n",
    "  * Mixed (or stepwise) - Use a mix of above to techniques.\n",

    "* **Text:** Useful techniques are tfidf, countvectorizers, word2vec, svd (dimensionality reduction). Stemming, spell checking, sparse matrices, likelihood encoding, one hot encoding (or dummies), hashing.\n",
    "* **Image classification:** Here you can do scaling, resizing, removing noise (smoothening), annotating etc.\n",
    "* **Sounds:** Calculate Furrier Transforms , MFCC (Mel frequency cepstral coefficients), Low pass filters etc.\n",
    "* **Everything else:** Univariate feature transformations (like log +1 for numerical data), feature selections, treating null values, removing outliers, converting categorical variables to numeric."
