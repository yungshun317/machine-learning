This project aims to develop a common strategy for machine learning problems. Some valuable resources I found including:

* [Machine Learning MindMap](https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap).
* [Winning Tips on Machine Learning Competitions by Kazanova](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/machine-learning/advanced-techniques/winning-tips-machine-learning-competitions-kazanova-current-kaggle-3/tutorial/).
* [Machine Learning Algorithms in Layman's Terms](https://towardsdatascience.com/@AudreyLorberfeld).

## Notebooks

* **Winning Tips on Machine Learning Competitions:** refers to [Kazanova's tips](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/machine-learning/advanced-techniques/winning-tips-machine-learning-competitions-kazanova-current-kaggle-3/tutorial/) and illustrate my own strategies with Python code examples.

## Projects

Some of my other machine learning projects also discussing general strategies:
* [Deep Learning Beginner Challenge](https://github.com/yungshun317/deep-learning-beginner-challenge): a competition I participated in when I began to learn deep neural network. The implemented CNN architectures include LeNet, ResNet, ResNeXt, SENet, and Wide ResNet.
* [fancyimpute Mammographic Mass Imputation](https://github.com/yungshun317/fancyimpute-mammographic-mass-imputation.git): a project investigates a variety of missing data imputation strategies including linear regression, MICE, KNN, FKM, SVD, bPCA, etc.
* On feature engineering pipeline:
  * [Feature Construction](https://github.com/yungshun317/feature-construction.git).
  * [Feature Improvement](https://github.com/yungshun317/feature-improvement.git).
  * [Feature Learning](https://github.com/yungshun317/feature-learning.git).
  * [Feature Selection](https://github.com/yungshun317/feature-selection.git).
  * [Feature Transformations](https://github.com/yungshun317/feature-transformations.git).
  * [Feature Understanding](https://github.com/yungshun317/feature-understanding.git).
* On time series forecasting with machine learning methods:
  * [Time Series Forecasting as Supervised Learning](https://github.com/yungshun317/time-series-forecasting-as-supervised-learning.git).
  * [Time Series Forecasting Feature Engineering](https://github.com/yungshun317/time-series-forecasting-feature-engineering.git).
